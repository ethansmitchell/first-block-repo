<h2>Class Policies</h2>

<h3>Assignments and Grading</h3>
<p><i><b>Homework</b></i>: Homework is assigned after each class and is
worth 5 to 10 points. A periodic quiz consisting of 1 or 2 homework problems 
may be given in place of homework.</p>

<p><i><b>Tests and Quizzes</b></i>: Tests and quizzes are essential to
check your understanding of the material. Quizzes are worth 10 to 25 points 
and will be given at least once a month. Tests are worth up to 100 points 
and will be given 3 times each semester.</p>

<p><i><b>Labs</b></i>: Labs are worth 10 to 30 points and will be graded on 
safety, participation, and write-up. Your reports should be neatly written or 
typed.</p>

<p><i><b>Research projects</b></i>: Research projects give you a chance to 
expand your knowledge beyond the classroom. There will be several research
projects throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>You can meet with Mr. Dub&#233; before or after school or during most lunch
hours in room H113. Do not hesitate to ask for help! It is very hard to catch 
up if you fall behind.</p>

<h3>Safety Rules</h3>
<p>Because of the potential danger of any lab exercise, you will be held to 
the highest standards of behavior, and will be removed from the class if you pose a 
threat to yourself or other students.</p>
