<h1>Euler, Leonhard</h1>
<h3>(1707-1783)</h3>

<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was 
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <i>800 different books</i> and 
papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's 
work on mathematical analysis, <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i> (1748) 
remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of 
Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lettres &#224; sune princesse d'Allemagne</i> (1768-1772), 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.</p>

<p>One can hardly write mathematical equations without copying Euler. Notations 
still in use today, such as <i>e</i> and <img src= "pi.jpg" title= "Pi" />, were developed by Euler. He is 
perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
formula:</p>


<p style= "text-align: center"> cos(<i>x</i>) + isin(<i>x</i>) = <i>e</i><sup>(ix)</sup></p>

<p>demonstrates the relationship between analysis, trignometry and imaginary 
numbers, in one beautiful and elegant equation.</p<

<p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
