<h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>

<p><b>Cryptography</b> is the science of secure communications, 
formed from the Greek words <i>krypt&#243;s</i> meaning "hidden" and <i>l&#243;gos</i>, meaning 
"word". The first recorded use of cryptography was by the Spartans who (as early as 400 BC) 
employed a cipher device called a "scytale" to send secret communications between military 
commanders. The scytale consisted of a tapered baton around which was wrapped a piece of parchment 
inscribed with the message. Once unwrapped the parchment appeared to contain an incomprehensible 
set of letters, however when wrapped around another baton of identical size the original text 
appears.

<p>Cryptographers developed more and more ingenious systems, 
but it was in the 20<sup>th</sup>century, that the science of cryptography took off. 
The first major achievement was the the development of rotor cipher machines. An American, 
Edward Hebern recognised that by hardwiring alphabetic substitution in the connections from 
one side of an electrical rotor to those on the other side and cascading a collection of such 
rotors, alphabetic substitutions of almost any complexity could be produced. Germany engineers 
independently discovered the rotor concept and designed the precursors to the most famous 
cipher machine in history - the German Enigma machine which was used during World War 2. The 
cracking of the Enigma ciphers byBritish and Polish cryptanalysts during the Second World War 
is one of the greatest triumphs inthe history of cryptography and played an important role in 
the Allie victory.</p>
