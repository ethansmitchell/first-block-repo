Exciting adventures await you at 
Arcadium, your affordable family fun center. The park is located 5 miles northwest of 
Derby - close to many of Georgia's scenic wonders. Arcadium supports over 50 rides, 
including some of the state's most exciting roller coasters and water rides. Come
and experience our newest ride, <b>G-Force</b>! There's also plenty of fun for the 
younger kids. The park provides two separate kiddie pools and special rides for the 
kids, and opening this spring, our new toddler park!</p>

<p>Arcadium is open seven days a week:</p>
<ul>
   <li>April 4<sup>th</sup> up to Memorial Day weekend: 10am to 5pm</li>
   <li>Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day: 9am to 11pm</li>
   <li>After Labor Day to October 31: 10am to 5pm</li>
   <li>November 1 to April 3<sup>rd</sup> : closed</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify">Arcadium is easy on your budget. Compare our low 
daily rates to the big chain parks. You can choose to purchase a gold ticket for 
any twenty rides, a plantium ticket for thirty rides, or for the best value, the 
full-day pass to ride as many times as you want, wherever you want. Special off-season 
and large group rates are available.</p>
