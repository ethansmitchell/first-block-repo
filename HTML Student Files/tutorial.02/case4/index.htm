<h2 id="why">
    Why Should You Buy?
</h2>

<ul>
Six key reasons why Body Systems equipment is built to last:

  <li> Body Systems uses only the highest quality materials and 
   components available.</li>

  <li> All equipment is built with durable, electrostatically applied 
   epoxy powder coat finish to resist scratching, chipping and peeling.</li>

  <li> Our pulley machines are built with impact resistant fiberglass 
   reinforced nylon pulleys with sealed bearings.</li>

  <li> Weight machines support a heavy-duty high tensile strength steel mainframe 
   construction.</li>

  <li> Support beams use four-side welded construction to keep torsional flex to 
   a minimum for solid and stable workouts.</li>

   <li>All weight macines use tear resistant pads and rollers feature high-density, 
   top grade foam for safety, comfort and stability.</li>
</ul>
