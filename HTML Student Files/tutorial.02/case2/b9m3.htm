<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The third movement represents a departure from the struggles of
the first two movements; but it does not cancel the need to resolve the
conflicts presented so far. However, there are the first hints of the
resolution to come in the fourth movement.</p>
<p>Beethoven begins this movement with a variation on the Devotion theme, 
which will prove to be increasingly important as the symphony continues.
In introducing the Devotion theme, Beethoven employs a technique known as
<i>diminution</i> in which each melody note is replaced by several notes
in smaller values. Beethoven unexpectedly fragments the theme in an 
interlude started by a clarinet and then imitated by the horn.</p>
