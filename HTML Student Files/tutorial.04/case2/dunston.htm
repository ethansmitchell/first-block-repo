            Welcome. Whether you are planning to attend one of our many conferences or 
            embarking on a private retreat, we're sure that you will enjoy your stay.</p>
      
            <p>Located in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat 
            Center provides comfortable and attractive accommodations while you 
            enjoy the rustic setting available just outside your door. The Retreat 
            Center has 32 beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, and kitchen facilities. 
            If you want to get out, there are ample opportunities for hiking, canoeing 
            and horseback riding in the surrounding area.</p>

                          I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat at Dunston. 
                          I came to your center haggard and worn out from a long illness and 
                          job difficulties. I left totally refreshed.</p>
             
                          <p>I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful
                          place you have. Some of us are hoping to organize a group retreat.
                          Rest assured that you'll see me again. Going to Dunston will become
                          a yearly event for me.</p>

            Throughout the year the center staff conducts retreats to accommodate 
            the needs of various groups. We offer retreats for men, for women, and for 
            couples. Please call about special needs retreats.</p>
      
            <p>If you prefer, an individually directed retreat is possible. The 
            retreat includes a time of daily sharing and guidance by a retreat 
            director to supplement your private time of solitude and meditation.</p>
      
            <p>At the Dunston Retreat Center we make everything as easy as possible, 
            providing meals, towels, bedding - everything you need. Just bring 
            yourself.</p>
