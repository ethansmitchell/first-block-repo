      Welcome. Whether you are planning to attend one of our many conferences or 
      embarking on a private retreat, we're sure that you will enjoy your stay.</p>

      <p>Located in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat 
      Center provides comfortable and attractive accommodations while you 
      enjoy the rustic setting available just outside your door. The Retreat 
      Center has 32 beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, and kitchen facilities. 
      If you want to get out, there are ample opportunities for hiking, canoeing 
      and horseback riding in the surrounding area.</p>

      <p>
      Throughout the year the center staff conducts retreats to accommodate 
      the needs of various groups. We offer retreats for men, for women, and for 
      couples. Please call about special needs retreats.</p>

      <p>If you prefer, an individually directed retreat is possible. The 
      retreat includes a time of daily sharing and guidance by a retreat 
      director to supplement your private time of solitude and meditation.</p>

      <p>At the Dunston Retreat Center we make everything as easy as possible, 
      providing meals, towels, bedding - everything you need. Just bring 
      yourself.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Adams<br />
      Director</p>
